Form of the stdIdentifiers file

The stdIdentifiers file has a strict form, as follows:

1. Entries are one per line, containing the characters
   of the identifer only, no blanks, tabs or comments.

2. All keywords must appear first, in the same order as
   the keyword tokens in parser.ssl

3. Following the keywords, the predefined identifiers appear,
   in the same order as the predefined identifier type 
   definition in semantic.ssl

4. "input" and "output" are special, and must be the last
   two lines in the file.
